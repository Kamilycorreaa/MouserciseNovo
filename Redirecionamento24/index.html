            The club isn't the best place to find a lover <BR>
            So the bar is where I go <BR>
            Me and my friends at the table doing shots <BR>
            Drinking fast and then we talk slow <BR>
            
            Come over and start up a conversation with just me <BR>
            And trust me, I'll give it a chance <BR>
            Now take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox <BR>
            And then we start to dance <BR>
            And now I'm singing like <BR>
            
            Girl, you know I want your love <BR>
            Your love was handmade for somebody like me <BR>
            Come on now, follow my lead <BR>
            I may be crazy, don't mind me <BR>
            Say: Boy, let's not talk too much <BR>
            Grab on my waist and put that body on me <BR>
            Come on now, follow my lead <BR>
            Come, come on now, follow my lead <BR>
            
            I'm in love with the shape of you <BR>
            We push and pull like a magnet do <BR>
            Although my heart is falling too <BR>
            I'm in love with your body <BR>
            And last night you were in my room <BR>
            And now my bedsheets smell like you <BR>
            Everyday discovering something brand new <BR>
            I'm in love with your body <BR>
            
            Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I <BR>
            I'm in love with your body <BR>
            Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I <BR>
            I'm in love with your body <BR>
            Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I <BR>

            One week in, we let the story begin <BR>
            We're going out on our first date <BR>
            You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat <BR>
            Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate <BR>
            
            We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour <BR>
            And how your family is doing okay <BR>
            Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat <BR>
            Tell the driver: Make the radio play <BR>
            And I'm singing like <BR>
            
            Girl, you know I want your love <BR>
            Your love was handmade for somebody like me <BR>
            Come on now, follow my lead <BR>
            I may be crazy, don't mind me <BR>
